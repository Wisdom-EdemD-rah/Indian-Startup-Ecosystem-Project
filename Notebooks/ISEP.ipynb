    "As the data expert on the team, I am tasked with conducting an in-depth analysis of the ecosystem to determine the factors that influence the funding received by startups in India. The goal is to identify whether the location of these startups plays a significant role in the amount of funding they receive. The analysis will focus on startup funding data spanning from 2018 to 2021. Separate datasets will be provided for each year, encompassing information about the startups, the funding amounts they received, and details about the investors involved. The primary objective is to investigate and understand whether the location of startups in India a meaningful impact on the funding has they secure. This analysis will inform my team with the strategic decisions and help us devise the most effective course of action within the Indian startup ecosystem.\n",
